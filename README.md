# Genetic Algorithm
Introduction
In Genetic Algorithm,

1-The evolution usually starts from a population of randomly generated individuals and happens in generations. 
2-In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated, multiple
individuals are selected from the current population (based on their fitness), and modified
to form a new population.
3- The new population is used in the next iteration of the algorithm. 
4- The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been
produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population.



Here Two different types of GA concepts are implemenetd 
firstly,
    Designed the GA for finding the best values of x,y,z for the given equation.

Secondly,
  I Ateempted to designed the fitness function of the 8 queens problem.
